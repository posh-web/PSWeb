# PSWeb
Community Web Framework to create and host beautifull web sites based on Microsoft PowerShell

# Objectives

The objective of this project is to offer a common web framework using PowerShell only (Or at least to try to!).
There are several projects currently running, that could be combined, and offered in a strong framework to offer a `end to end`solution to render Web pages

## Rendering language

The following DSL (Domain Specific Language) will be used a primary rendering language:

[PSHTML](https://github.com/Stephanevg/PSHTML)
[MarkDownToHtml](https://github.com/WetHat/MarkdownToHtml)


## Backend

The main idea, would be to keep the solution 'backend agnostic'. In this way, the user could chose the technical solution he preferes for his backend, 

### Backend solutions to consider

Microsoft has a 'non-official' project :[Polaris](https://github.com/PowerShell/Polaris)

Well know Javascript backend project: [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
