[PSHTML](https://github.com/Stephanevg/PSHTML)


## Backend

The main idea, would be to keep the solution 'backend agnostic'. In this way, the user could chose the technical solution he preferes for his backend, 

### Backend solutions to consider

Microsoft has a 'non-official' project :[Polaris](https://github.com/PowerShell/Polaris)

Well know Javascript backend project: [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
